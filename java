High Availability (HA):

Importance: Vital for uninterrupted system operation and user accessibility.
Strategies:
Redundancy: Duplicate critical components to mitigate failures.
Failover: Automatic switching to backup systems during a failure.
Load Balancing: Distributing workloads evenly to prevent bottlenecks.
Scalability: Adapting the system to handle increased demands.
Resilience:

Essentials:
Adaptability: Flexibility to adjust and respond to changing conditions.
Diversity: Having varied resources and strategies for robustness.
Risk Management: Identifying, analyzing, and planning for potential risks.
Crisis Response: Establishing protocols for swift recovery after disruptions.
Observability:

Components:
Logging: Recording detailed events for analysis and troubleshooting.
Monitoring: Continuous tracking of system metrics for real-time insights.
Tracing: Following the journey of requests through the system.
Metrics: Measuring quantitative data to assess system performance.
Monitoring:

Purpose: Early detection and resolution of issues to maintain system health.
Elements:
Alerts: Automated notifications for critical events or deviations.
Dashboards: Visual interfaces for quick and comprehensive system status checks.
Proactive Monitoring: Anticipating and addressing potential issues before they impact operations.
RTO and RPO:

RTO (Recovery Time Objective):
The maximum acceptable downtime after an incident for system recovery.
RPO (Recovery Point Objective):
The maximum acceptable data loss in case of a failure, indicating the point in time to which data must be recovered.
ROI (Return on Investment):

Calculation:
Evaluating the profitability of an investment by comparing the net gain or benefit with the initial cost.
Significance:
Informs decision-makers about the success and efficiency of investments.
OSI Model:

Layers:
Layers are seven types :1.physical 2.Datalink 3.Network 4.Transport 5.Session 6.Presentation 7 application
1.Physical:How to transmit signal,coding hardware means of sending and receving data on carrier
2. Data link:two party communication e thernet
3.Network:Routing &Forwarding address ip
4. Transport:End to end control and error and checking (ensure complete data transfer):TCP/UDP
5.session:Estabilish /manage connections
6.presentation:ASCII text ,sound syntax layer.
7.Application:File Transfer,Email,remote login
